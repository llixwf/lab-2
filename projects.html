    <h2>My projects</h2>
    <p>I really didn't have any big projects,but i hope it will be in the future</p>
    <h2>Apple project</h2>
    <p>My first project was in 4th grade and this project was related to an apple. That is, I studied the types of apples, how they are useful, what masks can be made with an apple or what kind of salad. And on this project I got 3rd place. After this project I learned a lot about apples, I can even differences them and find out what they taste like. This project was a great experience for me.</p>
